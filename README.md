The first five tasks are completed in the FunctionAssignments.cs file and are separated from each other with comments like //1st, //2nd, //3rd, and so on.

The query file for the sixth task and the screenshot are placed in the SQLAssignment folder, and they are completed using MS SQL.

The seventh, eighth, and ninth tasks are distributed in the 7th, 8th, and 9thTask files, respectively. In the project's entry point, I am calling only the ninth task, but by commenting it out, it is possible to call the eighth task as well.
